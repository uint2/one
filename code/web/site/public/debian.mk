	# Step 1: Add sudo capabilities to current user.
	# * With the assumption that sudo is not even installed yet.
	# * Do this step manually.
	#
	# 1. Change to root user with `su -`.
	#    Using any other method may not let us use `usermod`.
	# 2. Install sudo through the package manager.
	# 3. Run `usermod -aG sudo <username>`.
	#    From the help text of `usermod` itself:
	#      -a, --append                  append the user to the supplemental GROUPS
	#                                    mentioned by the -G option without removing
	#                                    the user from other groups
	#      -G, --groups GROUPS           new list of supplementary GROUPS
	# 4. That's it. Check that the user has indeed been added with `groups <username>`.
	# 5. Log the user out and back in.

	# * This requires sudo, which comes from step 1.

s3:
	# Step 3: Install NVIDIA drivers.
	# * This step requires `linux-headers` and `libglvnd-dev` to be installed.
	#
	# 1. Run `make s3-dl` to download the NVIDIA driver installer shell script.
	# 2. Run `make s3-install` to install the NVIDIA drivers.
	#     a) Select the MIT/GPL version instead of the NVIDIA Proprietary one.
	#        For some reason the Proprietary one has never worked before.
	#     b) To uninstall, run `make s3-uninstall`.
	#     c) For all options, run `make s3-help`.
	# 3. If you're experiencing issues, then maybe initramfs hasn't been updated
	#    by the NVIDIA driver installer. Run `make s3-initramfs` manually
	#    and then reboot.

	# Step 4: Install a window manager.
	# * We'll be using dwm.
	# * This requires the list of libraries in APT_LIST_DWM.
	#
	# 1. Run `make s4-get` to get the git repo.
	# 2. Go to that repo and build dwm and install it.

	# * At this point, it is assumed that we've installed stuff through APT
	#   already so /etc/apt/keyrings should already exist. Nevertheless, go
	#   and check that it exists manually.
	# Then,
	# 1. Run `make s5-key` to grab the GPG keys from Mozilla.
	# 2. Run `make s5-src` to add the Mozilla APT repository to your sources.list.
