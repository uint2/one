Welcome to Khang's personal guide to setting up Debian 13.
Intended audience: future Khang.

So you've (re)installed Debian 13. Probably because of some system error that
you can't fix and it's easier to just reset the system. Valid.

Pre-install
-----------

If you've forgot how to install Debian 13, here's a quick guide for the crux,
which is the hard-drive partitioning step: Clean out a partition and set the
mountpoint to root ("/"). That's it. The installer will take care of the rest.
Also, for pkgsel, uncheck  *every*  box. None of those are necessary.

Also, if your grub screen is blue, that's Debian's artistic choice. Edit
"/etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme" to remove that custom coloring. Also, to remove
grub's timeout, edit "/etc/default/grub" and set GRUB_TIMEOUT=-1, followed by
running "update-grub".

Post-install
------------

Now that you've booted into Debian 13 for the first time, there should be almost
nothing installed. Perfect.

To kickstart everything, we first install `sudo`. To do that, switch to the root
user using "su -". This is important because any other method may not expose the
`usermod` command. Then add as many users as you like to the "sudo" group:

  usermod -aG sudo <username>

Check that it worked with `groups <username>`. Then install `sudo` with

  apt update
  apt upgrade
  apt install sudo

Now log out and log back in, and users should have sudo access.

User space
----------

At this point, we're gonna install the Debian 13 setup runner found in
ssh://git@codeberg.org/nguyenvukhang/debian13.git. For that, we need git and
rust. So do

  apt install git curl wget
  curl -o rustup.sh --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs
  sh rustup.sh

and then we can install the automated setup runner with

  cargo install --git https://github.com/nguyenvukhang/debian13.git

To run the setup, simply execute "debian13". Once done, uninstall it with "cargo
uninstall debian 13".

Common Problems/FAQ
-------------------

If apps like Telegram fails to start or takes very long and glitches, try
removing either `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk` or `xdg-desktop-portal-gnome`.
